What is Crowd Funding?

An organization raises fund for specific works from people. And they donate to social causes, educations or any other charity
work.The target money needs to be collected before the designated deadline.

How does traditional Crowd Funding works? 

Here multiple people donate money to a particular crowd funding organization. After the money gets accumulated they are
supposed to donate the money to the designated social work. But in traditional Crowdfunding there is no gurantee that the 
money will be donated. Contributors has no way of knowing how the money is spend cause any kind of documents can be forged 
today . 

Why Implement Smart Contract into Crowdfunding?

But not blockchain. As we know smart contract is only get triggered if a certain event has happened. After the money gets
accumulated and the target is reached before deadline a voting is done among the Contributors. If 51% among the voters 
agrees , then only money can be donated to the designated cause. 

It is transparent and the data is stored in the block for everyone to see and once smart contract is written it cannot be 
changed so before meeting the condition the money can not be withdrwan and used in any other way, so forgery is avoided.


Entities:

1. Manager- He will create events for funding . will organize voting and if all the necessary coniditon is met will transfer 
the money to the designated cause.

2.Contributors- Will donate ether and participate in voting.

Basic Algorithm :
1.Manager will create a Crowdfunding with a deadline and target that needs to be met within the deadline.
2.Contributors will donate ether.
3. Events will be created by the manager with predetermined cause and donation needed for that.
4.Voting will be performed among the Contributors for a particular event.
5.If more than 50% agrees the money will be donated else not.

Important Points:
1.Contributors can only get a refund if the deadline is over and target is not met.
2. Contributors can donate only once.
3. Contributors can vote once for a particular event.
4.Contributors can donate only over the minimum amount and if the deadline is not over.
